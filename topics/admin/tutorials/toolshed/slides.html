## Tool Shed

- Galaxy "App Store"

- It is a free service that hosts repositories containing Galaxy tools.

- Installing from the Tool Shed takes care of
  - dependencies
  - reference data tables
  - configuration files

---

## Which Tool Shed?

The Main Tool Shed ( https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu ) serves all Galaxies worldwide.
- Everybody can create a repository.
- Repositories are public, including their whole history.

Local sheds can be run e.g. for private or custom-licensed tools.

???
We discourage running local TS.

---

## Vocabulary

* `wrapper` or `tool definition file` - The XML file that describes to Galaxy how the underlying software works, allowing Galaxy to render UI and execute the software in the right way.

* `repository` - A versioned code archive with tool(s) in Tool Shed.

* `revision` and `installable revision` - Every TS repo update generates a new revision but only certain (reproducibility-affecting) changes generate a new revision installable to Galaxy as a new version.

???
Every TS repo update can be propagated to the Galaxy though.

---
## Overview

* The Tool Shed is a hosting (not a development) platform.

* Each TS repository should link to its development repository.

* Tool Shed allows administrators to pick any installable revision.

* Multiple installable revisions of any repository can be present in Galaxy.

## Galaxy's Configuration

The list of available sheds is defined in `tool_sheds_conf.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<tool_sheds>
    <tool_shed name="Galaxy Main Tool Shed" url="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"/>
<!-- Test Tool Shed should be used only for testing purposes.
    <tool_shed name="Galaxy Test Tool Shed" url="https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"/>
-->
</tool_sheds>
```

### .shed.yml file

Contains tool's metadata.
```yml
categories:
- Text Manipulation
description: Remove lines from the beginning of a file.
long_description: |
  This tool removes the specified number of lines from the beginning
  of the input dataset.
name: remove_beginning
owner: devteam

└── tool_dependencies.xml # file that describes Galaxy how to get TS-supplied dependencies to fulfill the <requirements> in tool wrappers
```

---
### Tool requirements

Requirements of the wrapper.
```xml
<requirements>
    <requirement type="package" version="1.2">seqtk</requirement>
</requirements>
```

Galaxy aims to be dependency resolution agnostic.

---
## Dependency resolution

* We aim to make Galaxy resolver-independent but Conda-oriented.
* What resolver is going to be used for the tool dependency is determined at runtime
and prioritised in the config file `dependency_resolvers_conf.xml`.

```xml
<dependency_resolvers>
  <tool_shed_packages />
  <galaxy_packages />
  <conda />
  <galaxy_packages versionless="true" />
  <conda versionless="true" />
<!-- other resolvers
  <tool_shed_tap />
  <homebrew />
-->
</dependency_resolvers>
```

---

## Suite repositories

* To install multiple repositories some authors offer suites.
* Suite is a single repository that 'depends' on many others.
* If you install the suite, all 'dependency repositories' will be installed too.
