# What is uWSGI?

- Python WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) application framework
- Written in C
- Forking application server
- Optional HTTP server
- Process manager

...and the rest of the kitchen sink

---

# Why do we need uWSGI?

- Galaxy is a Python web application without a web server
- Implements standard Python WSGI
- Some other application does the web serving
- Technically we could use any HTTP/WSGI interface
  - Traditionally [Python Paste](https://github.com/cdent/paste/)

---

# What is uWSGI used for?

.left[In a production Galaxy server:]
- To start, manage, and scale web workers
- Optionally, to start, manage, and scale job handlers

---

# Why uWSGI?

Because Python can't multithread.

![Python GIL](../../images/gil.png)

.footnote[Image credit: [Dariusz Fryta](http://www.tivix.com/blog/lets-go-python/)]

???
Python can't multithread, but it can *multiprocess*.

---

# Why uWSGI?

- Fork many Galaxy server processes
- Isolate job functions from web functions
- Built in load balancing
- Speak native high performance uWSGI protocol to nginx
- Uninterrupted restarting
- Can do anything you can imagine: [uWSGI configuration options](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Options.html)

---

## uWSGI

- **Configuration**
- uWSGI wheel
- Job handler mules

---

## uWSGI Configuration File

uWSGI configuration is performed in the `uwsgi` key of `galaxy.yml`.

`galaxy.yml.sample` is never consulted.

.left[If using `run.sh`:]
- If no config exists, all necessary defaults are generated as command line arguments to uWSGI
- If a config exists, it is parsed, and any missing required options are passed as command line arguments to uWSGI

**Galaxy servers deployed with Ansible do not use `run.sh` and should fully specify their uWSGI configuration.**

---

## uWSGI default command line

Without a config file, the uWSGI command line is:

```sh-session
$ /home/nate/galaxy/.venv/bin/python3 .venv/bin/uwsgi \
    --module 'galaxy.webapps.galaxy.buildapp:uwsgi_app()' \
    --virtualenv /home/nate/galaxy/.venv --pythonpath lib \
    --threads 4 --http localhost:8080 \
    --static-map /static=/home/nate/galaxy/static --die-on-term \
    --hook-master-start 'unix_signal:2 gracefully_kill_them_all' \
    --hook-master-start 'unix_signal:15 gracefully_kill_them_all' \
    --enable-threads --py-call-osafterfork
```

---

## uWSGI command line

.left[Behind the scenes, `run.sh` calls `scripts/get_uwsgi_args.py`, which:]
- locates your config file (if any),
- parses it to determine whether you have set any of the default (or conflicting) options,
- determines the flags needed to run Galaxy.

You can take &quot;full control&quot; over this process by skipping `run.sh` and simply calling `uwsgi` directly, e.g. `uwsgi --yaml config/galaxy.yml`.

---

# uWSGI communication

- uWSGI can serve HTTP directly using the `--http` option
- uWSGI speaks a native protocol (which nginx also speaks) using `--socket`

A proxy server is not *required,* but its use is strongly encouraged for performance reasons.

---

## YAML config

uWSGI natively supports YAML configs (and INI, and PasteDeploy INI, and XML, and JSON, and ...)

**WARNING:** &quot;uWSGI YAML&quot; is not real YAML!

--

.pull-left[
Real YAML
```yaml
uwsgi:
    # quoting forces string
    socket: '127.0.0.1:8001'
    # proper YAML list
    mule:
      - lib/galaxy/main.py
      - lib/galaxy/main.py
```
]

.pull-right[
uWSGI &quot;YAML&quot;
```yaml
uwsgi:
    # quote chars read literally
    socket: '127.0.0.1:8001'
    # a uWSGI YAML &quot;list&quot;:
    #  repeat keys
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
```
]

---

## YAML config

- &quot;uWSGI YAML&quot; only applies to the `uwsgi` section of `galaxy.yml`
  - The `galaxy` section must use real YAML
- uWSGI can be compiled against libyaml for real YAML support
- Galaxy Ansible role can write *both* uWSGI (default), real YAML
- `galaxy.ini` is still usable but deprecated

---

## Configuration Schema

.center[`[config_schema.yml][config-schema]` contains possible options **and their types**.]

.left[config_schema.yml is the canonical source for config option documentation, from which:]
- .left[`[galaxy.yml.sample][config-sample]` is generated]
- [Galaxy configuration options documentation][config-docs] is generated

[config-schema]: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/release_20.01/lib/galaxy/webapps/galaxy/config_schema.yml
[config-sample]: https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/release_20.01/lib/galaxy/config/sample/galaxy.yml.sample
[config-docs]: https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/config.html

---

## uWSGI

- Configuration
- **uWSGI wheel**
- Job handler mules

---

## uWSGI Wheel

Galaxy's uWSGI is not built like standard `pip install uwsgi`

A bit of technical minutiae that might help debugging

---

## uWSGI Wheel

- The challenge:
  - Unlike Galaxy's other framework dependencies, uWSGI is not a Python library
  - uWSGI embeds the CPython interpreter
  - Essentially uWSGI *is* Galaxy's CPython

--

- The goal: Provide a no-compilation-required, no-dependencies installation method for Galaxy that includes uWSGI that:
  - Doesn't embed statically linked CPython
  - Doesn't require system `libpythonX.Y.so`
  - Uses system CPython

---

## uWSGI Wheel

The uWSGI wheel is built differently than when built from source with

`pip install uwsgi`

- From source by pip:
  - Built as a single `uwsgi` ELF binary embedding the CPython interpreter
- As the pyuwsgi wheel:
  - Built as a Python C extension into an ELF shared library `pyuwsgi.so`
  - Loaded by a stub `uwsgi` Python script by the CPython interpreter

pyuwsgi wheel: the only way to precompile uWSGI in a way that does not require `libpythonX.Y.so` or ship CPython

---

## uWSGI

- Configuration
- uWSGI wheel
- **Job handler mules**

---
class: top

## Processes and Job Handling

uWSGI starts up in a single &quot;master&quot; process and then `fork()`s a configured number of anonymous *web worker* processes to **serve web requests**.

By default, web workers also handle Galaxy job (tool execution) preparation and completion.

--

Processing Galaxy job (tool execution) preparation and finishing is somewhat resource intensive and affects web responsiveness.

Production Galaxy servers traditionally start additional dedicated Galaxy &quot;webless&quot; (do not serve web requests) *job handler* processes.

--

uWSGI provides a useful feature for running Galaxy job handlers: [uWSGI Mules](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Mules.html).

---

## uWSGI Mules

**Mules** are processes `fork()`ed from the uWSGI master after the application has been loaded and web workers have `fork()`ed.

Mules can continue to run the same code or can load and run arbitrary code.

Mules can receive messages from the web proceses.

Mules can be pooled in to *Farms*, and messages can be sent to the farm to be handled by any mule in that farm.

---

## Mule Advantages

.pull-left.reduce90[
Webless handlers
- Config is complex
- Must manage handler processes externally (e.g. w/ systemd)
- Handler assignment:
  - At random from configured handlers
  - No regard as to handler health
  - Notification via database
- Can be spread across multiple hosts
]

.pull-right.reduce90[
uWSGI Mule handlers
- Config is trivial
- Handler processes managed automatically by uWSGI master
- Handler assignment:
  - &quot;Grabbed&quot; by healthy mule
  - IPC (messaging) from web worker
- Mules run on same host as web workers
]

---

## Job Handler Mule Configuration

Adding job handler mules is performed by simply instructing uWSGI to start them in `galaxy.yml`:

```yaml
uwsgi:
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    mule: lib/galaxy/main.py
    farm: job-handlers:1,2
```

That's it! This Galaxy instance will now start and use two job handler mules.

---
class: top

## uWSGI Start/Run and Job Handling Lifecycle

1. Master process loads Galaxy application.
--

2. Master `fork()`s web worker processes and begins serving web requests.
--

3. Master `fork()`s job handler mules.
--

4. Mules reload Galaxy application as job handlers.
--

5. The first mule to fully initialize grabs a lock on the farm message queue.
--

6. All additional mules wait on the lock.
--

7. A web worker receives a request for a new job.
--

8. The web worker creates a `job` record in the database but leaves the `handler` field `null`.
--

9. The web worker uses uWSGI's `farm_msg()` function to notify the `job-handlers` farm that a new job is ready to run.
--

10. The mule with the lock receives the message, assigns itself, and gives up the lock.
--

11. Another mule acquires the lock and waits for the next message.
--

12. Job handling continues as normal.

---

## Advanced: Job Handler Assignment Methods

**Mules can only be used if web workers and job handlers run on the same host.**

The database can be used like a message queue to get the benefits of mules using webless job handlers.

See [Job Handler Assignment Methods](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html#job-handler-assignment-methods) for details.

Mules are preferred in scenarios where webless handlers are not needed.

---

## Advanced: Transparent Restart

Provides uninterrupted restart capability (clients do not notice restarts).

See [Transparent Restart](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/scaling.html#transparent-restart-zerg-mode) and [uWSGI Zerg Mode documentation](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Zerg.html) for details.

---

## Advanced: Zerg Mode + Job Handler Mules

Combining both advanced modes was long thought to be impossible.

However, a proof of concept has emerged!
