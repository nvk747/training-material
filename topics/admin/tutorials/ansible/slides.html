questions:
  - Why Ansible?
  - How and when to use Ansible?
  - How to write a role?
  - How to leverage community build roles?
objectives:
  - Learn Ansible basics
  - Write a simple role
  - Install a role from Ansible Galaxy
key_points:
  - Ansible lets you do system administration at scale
  - Many system administration, software installation, and software management tasks are already available as Ansible tasks or roles

## Configuration Management

- Manages the configuration of machines

- Specifies what software is installed, how it is configured

---

### Why Configuration Management?

- Are you keeping track of config changes?
- What if your server dies?
- ... or your VM is accidentally deleted?
- Can you recover? How quickly?

---

### Configuration Management goals

- Reproducibility

- Ensure 1000s of machines are correctly configured

- Easily recover from bad situations

---

### Ansible

- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open-source configuration management tool, sponsored by Red Hat

- Several [alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-source_configuration_management_software) are available (Chef, Puppet, Salt, etc)

- It uses an agentless model: SSH into machine and executes commands

- Very popular, especially among Galaxy admins!

- Many modules for common tasks like copying files or managing users or services.

---

## Important Terms

---

### Inventory File

Defines the systems (called "hosts") against which Ansible will work.

```ini
[webservers]
192.168.0.1
192.168.0.2 ansible_user=ubuntu

[databases]
db_1.example.org ansible_user=root
```

???

The headings in square brackets are group names, used to select a set of systems on which Ansible should operate.

It is possible to assign variables to hosts and groups to be used later in playbooks.

---

### Ansible Module and Tasks

A **module** is a piece of code that Ansible can execute on a host, collecting return values.

A **task** is an invocation of single module with its configuration.

```yaml
---
- copy:
    src: foo.conf
    dest: /etc/foo.conf
    owner: foo
    group: foo
    mode: 0644

- package:
    name: ntpdate
    state: present
```

???

Here is an example of invoking the `copy` module and the package module. Copy copies a file from `src` on the local host to destination (the remote host) and sets some attributes about the file

Next we see an example of the `package` module, a generic OS package manager. It ensures that for the package named `ntpdate`, its state is `present` (i.e. installed)

---

### Role

.pull-left[
A collection of:

- tasks
- files
- templates
- variables
- handlers

]

.pull-right[
with a predefined directory structure:
```
.
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── files
│   └── cvmfs_wipecache.centos_7
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│   └── main.yml
├── README.md
├── tasks
│   ├── apache.yml
│   ├── main.yml
│   └── stratumN.yml
├── templates
│   └── stratum1_squid.conf.j2
├── tests
│   ├── inventory
│   └── test.yml
└── vars
    └── main.yml

```
]

???

**Tasks** will be executed which will usually include tasks to **copy** files from the `files` directory and **template** files from the `templates` directory over to the remote server.

**variables** are defined for use in the templates and tasks, and **handlers** are used to automatically restart services when configuration changes.

---

### Playbook

A YAML file listing a set of tasks and/or roles that should be applied to a group of hosts.

.pull-left[
- We define a playbook which has a name
- And applies to some group of hosts
- We specify some additional variables
- And then invoke some roles
]


.pull-right[
```yaml
- name: CVMFS
  hosts: all
  vars:
    cvmfs_role: client
    galaxy_cvmfs_repos_enabled: true
  roles:
    - geerlingguy.repo-epel
    - galaxyproject.cvmfs
```
]


---

### Vault

- Ansible playbooks should be kept under **version control** (typically with Git)
- Playbooks can be safely shared on public Git repositories (e.g. GitHub) by storing secrets like passwords in encrypted files called **vaults**

```
$ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256

## Ansible Philosophies

- Some people write a single playbook that completely manages a machine (installing everything on a brand new machine)

- Other people write playbooks for a single task (e.g. upgrading software)

- Which one depends on your use case.
---

## Ansible Galaxy

- Public repository of roles

- Many for common software deployment (nginx, apache, postgresql)

- Different "Galaxy" than the bioinformatics tool server (but Ansible can be used to install that too!)
