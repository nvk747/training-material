## Galaxy tools

* A Galaxy `tool` or `wrapper` is an XML file describing how some software program works
  * allows Galaxy to display the tool interface and execute the software in the right way
* The underlying softwares needed to execute the tool command are called `requirements` or `dependencies`

---

## Tool Shed

- Galaxy "App Store"
- It is a free service that hosts repositories containing Galaxy tools.
- The Tool Shed is a hosting (not a development) platform.
  - Each repository should link to its development repository.

# Ways to add tools

You can add tools to Galaxy either

* Manually - useful for tool development.
* From the Tool Shed
  * Through the admin UI in Galaxy
  * Using **ephemeris** (recommended)

---

## How to add tools manually

- By default Galaxy adds all tools listed in `tool_conf.xml.sample` to the tool panel
- To add a local tool by hand:
  - Make a copy `$ cp tool_conf.xml.sample tool_conf.xml`
  - Add your tool entry to the `tool_conf.xml`
- To add local tools with the [galaxyproject.galaxy Ansible role][galaxy-role]:
  - Set `galaxy_local_tools` to the local tool paths
  - Run the playbook
- Tool dependencies need to be installed separately, unless
  `conda_auto_install: true` is set in `galaxy.yml` (not recommended for
  production)

## How to install tools from the Tool Shed

- From the Galaxy admin UI, select "Tool Management > Install and Uninstall"
- Find the repository with the tool(s) you want to install
- Install the tool repository into Galaxy

---

## Advantages of using the Tool Shed

- Installing from the Tool Shed takes care of
  - dependencies
  - reference data tables
  - configuration files
- Multiple versions ("installable revisions") of a repository can be installed to preserve reproducibility

---

## Which Tool Shed?

- The Main Tool Shed ( https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu ) serves all Galaxies worldwide.
  - Everybody can create a repository.
  - Repositories are public, including their whole history.
- The Test Tool Shed ( https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu ) can be used for repositories not yet production-ready.
- Local sheds can be run e.g. for private or custom-licensed tools.

???

Repositories on the TTS are also public.

We discourage running local TS.

## Which Tool Shed? - Configuration

The list of available Tool Sheds is defined in `tool_sheds_conf.xml`:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<tool_sheds>
    <tool_shed name="Galaxy Main Tool Shed" url="https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"/>
<!-- Test Tool Shed should be used only for testing purposes.
    <tool_shed name="Galaxy Test Tool Shed" url="https://testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/"/>
-->
</tool_sheds>
```

---

## How to install with Ephemeris

* Find the repository you want to install.
* Run `shed-tools install` with the repository name

---

# What is ephemeris and what does it do?

Small Python library for Galaxy Management

* Can install:
	- Tools
	- Reference data
	- Workflows
	- Data libraries
* `$ pip install ephemeris`
* https://github.com/galaxyproject/ephemeris
* https://ephemeris.readthedocs.io

```

---

## Data tables and loc files

- Several tools need to access **reference data**, e.g. genome sequences or indexes for aligner
- A *loc file* is a tab-separated file containing metadata and paths for a set of reference data
- A *data table* describes the columns of a loc file used by a tool
- You can read more about this in the [Reference Genomes in Galaxy slides](../reference-genomes/slides.html)

---

## Suite repositories

- Suites can be used to split up a set of tools into multiple repositories
  - A suite is a single repository that 'depends' on many others
  - When you install the suite, all 'dependency repositories' will be installed too
- With a tweak to `.shed.yml`, [Planemo](https://planemo.readthedocs.io) can upload a directory of tools to the TS as a suite of separate tools

---

## What happens when installing a repo from TS

* The repository is downloaded
* If needed, `.loc` files and data tables are installed
* If needed, the tools' dependencies are installed
* An entry for each tool is created in the Galaxy database
* The tools are added to `shed_tool_conf.xml`

## Example `shed_tool_conf.xml` entry

```xml
<section id="filter" name="Filter and Sort" version="">
  <tool file="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/23a1c1f66b47/bamtools_filter/bamtools-filter.xml" guid="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1">
      <tool_shed>testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu</tool_shed>
        <repository_name>bamtools_filter</repository_name>
        <repository_owner>devteam</repository_owner>
        <installed_changeset_revision>23a1c1f66b47</installed_changeset_revision>
        <id>testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1</id>
        <version>0.0.1</version>
    </tool>
</section>
```

This file should be modified only to hide a tool from the panel.

## Tool dependency resolution

* We aim to make Galaxy resolver-independent, with a preference for [conda](https://conda.io/) and containers
* What resolver is going to be used for the tool dependencies is determined at runtime
according to the order specified in `dependency_resolvers_conf.xml`.

```xml
<dependency_resolvers>
  <tool_shed_packages />
  <galaxy_packages />
  <conda />
  <galaxy_packages versionless="true" />
  <conda versionless="true" />
<!-- other resolvers
  <lmod />
  <lmod versionless="true" />
  <modules modulecmd="/opt/Modules/3.2.9/bin/modulecmd" />
  <modules modulecmd="/opt/Modules/3.2.9/bin/modulecmd" versionless="true" default_indicator="default" />
  <tool_shed_tap />
  <homebrew />
-->
</dependency_resolvers>
```

## Dependency resolution example

A tool XML contains:

```xml
<tool id="foo">
    <requirements>
        <requirement type="package" version="4.2">bar</requirement>
    </requirements>
</tool>
```

---
class: left

## `<tool_shed_packages />`

Did tool `foo` depend on a Tool Shed package providing `bar` 4.2 when installed?
- Yes: Query install DB for `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `changeset_id`, then source:
  - `<tool_dependencies_dir>/bar/4.2/<repo_owner>/<repo_name>/<changeset_id>/env.sh`
- No: continue

---
class: left

## `<galaxy_packages />`

Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/4.2/env.sh` exist?:
- Yes: source it
- No: Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/4.2/bin/` exist?:
  - Yes: prepend it to `$PATH`
  - No: continue

Good for dependencies manually installed by an administrator

---
class: left

## `<conda />`

Does `bar==4.2` exist in Conda?:
- Yes: use `conda create` to create a Conda env in `<conda_prefix>/envs/` (if it doesn't exist already), then activate it
- No: continue

[Conda for tool dependencies FAQ](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/en/master/admin/conda_faq.html)

---
class: left

## `<galaxy_packages versionless="true" />`

Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/default/` exist and is it a symlink?:

- Yes: Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/default/env.sh` exist?:
  - Yes: source it
  - No: Does `<tool_dependency_dir>/bar/default/bin/` exist?:
      - Yes: prepend it to `$PATH`
      - No: continue
- No: continue

---
class: left

## `<conda versionless="true" />`

Does `bar` (any version) exist in Conda?:
- Yes: use `conda create` to create env in job working directory
- No: continue

---
class: left

## `<modules modulecmd="..." />`

Is `bar/4.2` a registered module?:
- Yes: Load module `bar/4.2`
- No: continue

See: [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/)

---
class: left

## `<modules modulecmd="..." versionless="true" />`

Is `bar/default` a registered module?:
- Yes: Load module `bar/default`
- No: continue

---

## If dependency is not resolved

Submit the job anyway, maybe it's available on `$PATH`

---

## Using containers for Tool Dependencies

- Galaxy can also use **Docker** or **Singularity** containers to resolve dependencies
- You can read more about this in the [Tool Dependencies and Containers slides](../../../dev/tutorials/containers/slides.html)

---

## Tool panel management

* How the tool panel looks like is decided in a file called `integrated_tool_panel.xml`.
* By default it resides in Galaxy's `config/` folder.
* If missing it is generated from all other tool config files during startup.
* Modify it if you want to reorder tools or move section.

```xml
<section id="filter" name="Filter and Sort" version="">
    <tool id="testtoolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repos/devteam/bamtools_filter/bamFilter/0.0.1" />
</section>
```
